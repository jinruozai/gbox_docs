# Gbox Examples Rules

## Description
These rules provide context for understanding Gbox examples and sample code patterns.

## Files
examples/*.gb, examples/*.gbz

## Reference Files
@examples/simple_game.gb
@examples/enum_example.gb
@examples/preprocessor_example.gb

## Rules

### Example Code Understanding
- Use the provided example files as reference implementations
- Understand common patterns demonstrated in the examples
- Learn from the code organization and structure in example files

### Learning from Examples
- When working with Gbox scripts, refer to similar patterns in the examples
- Recognize how different features are implemented in practice
- Observe naming conventions and code style from the examples

### Adaptation Guidelines
- When adapting example code, maintain consistent style and conventions
- Understand the purpose of each example before modifying it
- Use examples as starting points for new implementations

### Advanced Features
- Study the examples to understand more advanced Gbox features
- See how enums are implemented in `enum_example.gb`
- Learn about preprocessor features from `preprocessor_example.gb`
- Understand game structure from `simple_game.gb`
